        It is not ideal to exclude a menu from inner pages, but the
        focus is on data visualization, not site design. This
        'breadcrumb' approach will keep things simple while the
        site added to week-to-week, but considers the necessity to
        to swap out the nav on each page (for the completed one on
        'index.html') and make minor modifications to 'style.css' to
        create a more robust site nav once all examples are complete.

        <p>When I was taking the class, I was expecting that we would jump right into D3 or some other tools, so when I saw the first lecture on data cleaning itself I was surprised. But as the lecture unfold, I started to realize the importance of this very first step. This seemingly basic step that I initially neglected is actually the basic of any interactive data visualization. Having a clean data sets a good start and will save a lot of time for all the future steps.</p>
        <p>Consistency is the key for a clean data set. Naming everything in the same way, having all dates and other things in the same format and making sure there is never extra space or other special characters allows the computer to process data smoothly so that there is no error in your visualization due to the problem with data itself.</p>
        <p>Besides being consistent, other small things like always keeping a data dictionary, not using calculation in the raw data file and always making backups are all helpful habits to have when doing data visualization to keep data stay organized and ready to be used.</p>
        <p>The exercise we did in class on Titanic survivors gives a perfect example of an unorganized data and not-so-good set. For data like this, a lot of cleaning needs to be done before it can actually be used into coding. </p>
        <p>As for cleaning data, Excel seem to be a very basic yet powerful tool. It also helps with data organization and filtering. Through the class exercise, I saw how a messy data set can be organized for use and analysis for our purpose. Even without data visualization, with sort and filter, Excel helps to see the pattern of various information and gives better understanding of a particular data. Its powerful calculation functions and tools like pivot table can be widely used during data cleaning and interpreting step which prepares for a good data visualization.</p>
