        It is not ideal to exclude a menu from inner pages, but the
        focus is on data visualization, not site design. This
        'breadcrumb' approach will keep things simple while the
        site added to week-to-week, but considers the necessity to
        to swap out the nav on each page (for the completed one on
        'index.html') and make minor modifications to 'style.css' to
        create a more robust site nav once all examples are complete.
